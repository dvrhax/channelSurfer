# channelSurfer

Kodi addon to emulate old school channel surfing with your movie library.

Usage - run the Channel Surfer addon filter by genre/watched and hit play.  You can skip to the next "channel" by hitting the next button.

*Current skips to between 1 and 5 minutes into the movie to more emulate stumbling on a random movie to watch on the tv.

TODO:
Create a settings page to control the time shift at the beginning.
Figure out the callback functions to get better control over playback
Add functionality to reset resume position so it doesn't litter your In-Progress bar.
